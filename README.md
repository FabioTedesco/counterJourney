## THE IDEA 
"Counter Journey" is a simple game created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core of the experience is a virtual dice, activated by pressing a button, which determines the number of spaces the player advances. Each movement is associated with a "+" button, which must be pressed a number of times equal to the value of the dice.

The game transports the player through different squares, each represented by a flag of a country. An  airplane accompanies the player during the journey, moving from one flag to another with each press of the "+" button.

Surprises are an integral part of the adventure, with positive and negative unforeseen events that can influence the course of the journey. Some events lead to forward movements, while others may force the little airplane to take a step back.
